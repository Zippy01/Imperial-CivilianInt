# Imperial-CivilianInt
This script allows Imperial CAD community user's to set an active civ in game, similar to a framework and creating ease for any related civilian commands in game such as registering a vehicle from in game to CAD, or such as our DriversLic Script. (This is required for most of our civilian related scripts)

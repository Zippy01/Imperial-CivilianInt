# Imperial CivilianInt Script

The **CivilianInt** script allows users in the *Imperial CAD* community to manage an active civilian profile within the game. This setup simplifies access to civilian-related commands, including in-game vehicle registration with CAD or integration with scripts like the *DriversLic Script*. This script is essential for most civilian-related functionalities within the *Imperial CAD* system.

## Installation

To install the **CivilianInt** script, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script Files**  
   Download the latest release from this repository.

2. **Add to Your Server Resources**  
   Place the `CivilianInt` folder into your server's resources directory.

3. **Set Up your Community ID convar**  
   All Imperial Scripts rely on a `community ID` to function. To set this up:
   
   - Locate your community ID in *Admin Panel > Customization > Community ID*.
   - Add the following line at the top of your `server.cfg` file:
     ```plaintext
     setr imperial_community_id "COMMUNITY_ID_HERE"
     ```
   - **Note**: If you've already set this up for another *Imperial CAD* plugin, you can skip this step. Without this configuration, Your Imperial Scripts will return a error in the console.

4. **Ensure Resources in `server.cfg`**  
   Add the following lines to your `server.cfg` to ensure the Imperial *CivilianInt* loads correctly:
   ```plaintext
   ensure CivilianInt
   ```

5. **Configure Additional Vehicles**  
   Inside the `CivilianInt` folder, you'll find a `Library` folder containing a script named `vehicles.lua`. This file lists supported vehicle makes for registration. If you need to add additional vehicles not currently listed, open `vehicles.lua` and add them here to ensure the make displays correctly when registered in CAD. 

6. **Restart Your Server**  
   Restart your server to apply the changes.
